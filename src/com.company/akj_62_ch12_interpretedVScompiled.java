/*Interpreter Vs Compliler :
The interpreter translates one statement at a time into machine code. On the other hand, the compiler scans the entire program and translates the whole of it into machine code
Interpreter :
1.	one statement at a time
2.	An interpreter is needed every time
3.	Partial execution if an error occurs in the program.
4.	Easy for programmers.
Compiler :
1.	Entire program at a time
2.	Once compiled, it is not needed
3.	No execution if an error occurs
4.	Usually not as easy as interpreted once
