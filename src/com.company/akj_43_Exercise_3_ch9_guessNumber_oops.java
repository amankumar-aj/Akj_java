            Create a class Game, which allows a user to play "Guess the Number"
            game once. Game should have the following methods:
            1. Constructor to generate the random number
            2. takeUserInput() to take a user input of number
            3. isCorrectNumber() to detect whether the number entered by the user is true
            4. getter and setter for noOfGuesses
            Use properties such as noOfGuesses(int), etc to get this task done!
