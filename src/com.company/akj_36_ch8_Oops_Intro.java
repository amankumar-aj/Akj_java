•	Object-Oriented Programming tries to map code instructions with real-world, making the code short and easier to understand.
•	With the help of OOPs, we try to implement real-world entities such as an object, inheritance, abstraction, etc.
•	OOPs helps us to follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) approach of programming, which in turn increases the re-usability of the code.
Two most important aspects of OOPs - Classes & Objects:
Class :
•	A class is a blueprint for creating objects.
•	Classes do not consume any space in the memory.
•	Objects inherit methods and variables from the class.
•	It is a logical component.


Objects :
•	An object is an instantiation of a class. When a class is defined, a template (info) is defined.
•	Every object has some address, and it occupies some space in the memory.
•	It is a physical entity.
