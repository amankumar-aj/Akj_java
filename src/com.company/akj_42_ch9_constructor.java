/*
(New) is a keyword that allocates space in the memory of object.
[101]
Constructor : Constructor is a special method which is invoked
automatically at the time of object creation. It is used to initialize the data members of new objects generally.
Non-Parameterized constructor : A constructor which has no argument is known as non-parameterized constructor(or no-argument constructor).
It is invoked at the time of creating an object. If we donâ€™t create one then it is created by default by Java

[102]
Parameterized constructor : Constructor which has parameters is called a parameterized constructor. It is used to provide
different values to distinct objects.

[103]
Copy Constructor : A Copy constructor is an overloaded
constructor used to declare and initialize an object from another object.
There is only a user defined copy constructor in Java(C++ has a default one too)

********NOTE*****
Note : Unlike languages like C++, Java has no Destructor. Instead,
Java has an efficient  garbage collector that deallocates memory automatically.
